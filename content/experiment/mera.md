Mera is a Canon EOS 600D DSLR running a modified build of [Magic Lantern](http://magiclantern.fm/), a Free and Open Source firmware addon (GPL v3).

The firmware allows for more granular control of the camera, particularly when recording video. By default, the 600D limits video recording to 12 minutes in duration before shutting down. ML allows for the camera to run for as long as the camera memory and temperature allows (before the lens begins to emit too much heat), and can record HDR video as well.
