Sessions last 60 minutes-several hours depending on your needs, and take place in my studio, your place of work or remotely via Jitsi or Zoom.

We can talk, draw, write, sit, make coffee, walk around the block and ponder. Dreaming up together can help to bring form to whatever you may be thinking about.

I believe anything can be an idea depending on the way it is seen and treated. I love a project-based approach to making, giving the smallest of ideas the potential for great lateral growth.

I work with design studios, advertising agencies, start ups, and collaborate with creative teams, established creative directors, strategists, planners, architects, non creatives, entrepreneurs, young and old, local and international.

Everything generated in the meeting is yours, and remains confidential.
