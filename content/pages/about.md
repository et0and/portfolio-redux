"_Nahau te rourou_
_Naku te rourou_
_Ka ora ai te manuhiri_"

"With your basket of knowledge
and my basket of knowledge
the people will prosper"

Hi, I'm Tom,
I am a designer with a background in the arts and education. Presently I am working as a web producer in P≈çneke, Te Whanganui-a-Tara. Prior to this, I taught design, art and digital technology at [Takapuna Grammar School](https://takapuna.school.nz), where I also worked on the development of [Te WƒÅhi Auaha](https://tewahi.com) (a school maker space and innovation space).

My experience in making learning more accessible and equitable across a range of students from different backgrounds and abilities built the foundation of my human-centered design practice. Anything I make or work on is [guided by these set of values](/values "a list of values I work by").

Previously I studied at the [Elam School of Fine Arts](https://elamartists.ac.nz/ "Elam School of Fine Arts"), where I also briefly taught the first and second year studio programme. 

Find me on [are.na](https://are.na/tom "Are.na"), [Read.cv](https://read.cv/hackshaw "Read.cv"), [Merveilles](https://merveilles.town/@tomupom "Merveilles, a Mastodon instance"). Sometimes, I am on IRC as @tomupom on [Libera Chat](https://libera.chat/) and [Rizon](https://rizon.net/) networks. You can also find me on [Urbit](https://urbit.org) as `~worbur-dorneb`.

I have accounts on other popular social media sites, but rarely use them.

I would like to acknowledge MƒÅori as tangata whenua and Te Tiriti o Waitangi partners in Aotearoa New Zealand. I pay my respects to the mana whenua who are the original and continued rightful stewards of the land that I love and on which I work and reside.
