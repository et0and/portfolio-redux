Hi, I'm Tom,
I am a product designer with a background in the arts and education. I have experience in visual arts and design teaching where I developed my leadership and communication skills.

My experience in making learning more accessible and equitable across a range of students from different backgrounds and abilities built the foundation of my human-centered design practice. Anything I make or work on is [guided by these set of values](/values "a list of values I work by").

Previously I studied at the [Elam School of Fine Arts](https://elamartists.ac.nz/), where I also briefly taught the first and second year studio programme. 

Find me on [are.na](https://are.na/tom-y "Are.na"), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tom-hackshaw "LinkedIn"), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tomhackshaw "Twitter"), [Merveilles](https://merveilles.town/@tomupom "Merveilles, a Mastodon instance")
