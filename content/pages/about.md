Hi, I'm Tom,
I am a designer interested in making products that are accessible, beautiful and fun.

Presently I am a high school teacher teaching art and design in Tāmaki Makaurau, so in a very real way people have always deeply informed my work. Anything I make or work on is [guided by these set of values](/values "a list of values I work by")

Previously I studied at the [Elam School of Fine Arts](https://elamartists.ac.nz/), where I also briefly taught the first and second year studio programme. 

Find me on [are.na](https://are.na/tom-y "Are.na"), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tom-hackshaw "LinkedIn"), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tomhackshaw "Twitter"), [Merveilles](https://merveilles.town/@tomupom "Merveilles, a Mastodon instance")

or say hi: [tom@tomhackshaw.com](mailto:tom@tomhackshaw.com "my email address") ([PGP](/media/pubkey.txt "my pgp public encryption key")) / [~falsef-nostyp](web+urbitgraph://group/~falsef-nostyp/tom-s-room-3993 "link to my urbit")
