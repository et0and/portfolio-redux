This is my humble website of projects and resources.
This site is always under construction. It was last updated on Monday 27 April, 2020 in Tāmaki Makaurau, Aotearoa.

Prior to working in education I came from an art and design background. This is important.

I’ve had a fascination with the Web and technology from a young age, and got to know all kinds of different people through IRC and Usenet channels. I feel as though I grew up on the Internet, and that it has taught me a lot of what I know.

I am of the belief that the World Wide Web is a genuine social accomplishment and that we, as custodians of the Internet, should take care of it. I am reluctant to use monolithic platforms, particularly social media, as I feel these are walled gardens or closed silos.

This site is a labour of love. While it isn’t the most flash or professional looking, it is something that I tend to often. I can continually add to it, change things, and watch it grow. I consider it to be akin to a house or garden, one I will upkeep to make it beautiful.

If what I see in or express of myself reminds you of your own actions, then together we’ve made something and that’s awesome!

Sincerely,
Tom Hackshaw
