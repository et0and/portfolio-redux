<h1> Hi! I'm Tom, </h1>

Since leaving university, I've been lucky to have a multidisciplinary education and explore many fields of study + work; having these experiences has enriched my practice as a designer and creative. In my work as a design teacher, I am always excited by the potential and possibilities generated by my students, and how their approach allows me to learn new things and challenge my own perspectives.

I’ve always admired how good design has the power to shape our world. Whether it’s through simplifying one interaction, drawing connections that weren’t previously there or giving users an opportunity to view things through a new lens, I love working on projects that make people happy. 

Aside from design, I enjoy 3D printing, coffee runs, and binging episodes of Danish crime dramas.
