Hi, I'm Tom, and this is my humble website of projects and resources.
I am a designer interested in making products more easy, beautiful and fun.

Prior to working in design I came from an arts and education background, so in a very real way people have always deeply informed my work. Anything I make or work on is [guided by these set of values](/values "a list of values I work by")

I’ve always admired how good design has the power to shape our world. Whether it’s through simplifying one interaction, drawing connections that weren’t previously there or giving users an opportunity to view things through a new lens, I love working on projects that make people happy. 

Find me on [are.na](https://are.na/tom-y "Are.na"), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tom-hackshaw "LinkedIn"), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tomhackshaw "Twitter"), [Merveilles](https://merveilles.town/@tomupom "Merveilles, a Mastodon instance")
