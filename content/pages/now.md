Continuing working and practising with different types of graphic design for Nothing Market. Have been trying to focus on a simple black and red colour palette at the moment to improve consistency across my different designs.

Been working on creating some dummy posters to get my graphic design skills up to speed. Been using a variety of tools including Figma, Framer, and Inkscape to get the job done. A lot of the posters have been inspired by existing designs that I really liked the look of and have attempted to reverse-engineer to my liking.

Created this now page for the purpose of documenting short snippets of what I am working on, similar to a development changelog.
