*Tools should be open and adaptable*
If a tool does not fit my needs, I should be able to freely change, modify or personalise its parts.

*Technology should not be used as a substitute for things*
If a piece of technology does not augment, modify or redefine an existing paradigm then it is not necessary.

*Protocols over platforms*
Technology, software and the web should be decentralised + accessible by design, and not siloed into platforms or islands that hold the user and their data hostage.

*Sustainability, longevity, and balance should take precedence*
Any project or action that I undertake should be oriented around these values.

*Economic, social, and ecological injustices are all interconnected*
Anything that I do, particularly things that concern other people directly or indirectly, should be done in relation to this

*Collaboration should be encouraged*
Always strive towards working with others so together we can achieve more, and develop a greater sense of our own individuality.

*Alignment with Te Tiriti o Waitangi*
Understand the importance of tikanga MƒÅori, taonga, and the principles of partnership, participation and protection that make up the Treaty.

*Contributing to the establishment of a One Asia*
Work on and support the efforts of others to promote the formation of an Asian Community of the future (see [here](/projects/new-asia-group))
