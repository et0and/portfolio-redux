I am committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience in accordance with the New Zealand Web Accessibility standards and WCAG guidelines, and am committed to providing a positive experience to all users as I strive to promote accessibility and inclusion.

I am actively working to increase accessibility and usability of my website to everyone. At present, I am working on adding alt text to all images on my website. If you are using a screen reader or other auxiliary aid and are having problems using this website, please contact me at <a href="javascript:location='mailto:\u0061\u0063\u0063\u0065\u0073\u0073\u0040\u0074\u006f\u006d\u0068\u0061\u0063\u006b\u0073\u0068\u0061\u0077\u002e\u0063\u006f\u006d';void 0"><script type="text/javascript">document.write('\u0061\u0063\u0063\u0065\u0073\u0073\u0040\u0074\u006f\u006d\u0068\u0061\u0063\u006b\u0073\u0068\u0061\u0077\u002e\u0063\u006f\u006d')</script></a>. Whether you are using assistive technologies like a screen reader, a magnifier, voice recognition software, or captions for videos, my goal is to make your visit to this website a successful and enjoyable experience.

If you have difficulty using or accessing any element of this website, please feel free to email me at the above email and I will work with you to provide the information, item, or element you seek through a communication method that is accessible for you consistent with applicable law. If you would like to ask a question about my work and projects please send queries to <a href="javascript:location='mailto:\u0074\u006f\u006d\u0040\u0074\u006f\u006d\u0068\u0061\u0063\u006b\u0073\u0068\u0061\u0077\u002e\u0063\u006f\u006d';void 0"><script type="text/javascript">document.write('\u0074\u006f\u006d\u0040\u0074\u006f\u006d\u0068\u0061\u0063\u006b\u0073\u0068\u0061\u0077\u002e\u0063\u006f\u006d')</script></a>.

I am currently taking a variety of steps and devoting resources to further enhance the accessibility of my website. Using tools such as WAVE and Lighthouse I am working towards greater accessibility of this website, and hope to work with an independent experienced accessibility consultant sometime in the future to conduct a deeper audit.
