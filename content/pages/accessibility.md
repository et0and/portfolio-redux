I am currently taking a variety of steps and devoting resources to further enhance the accessibility of my website. Currently, I am working on implementing proper keyboard navigation with appropriate hover and focus state. After this I will be looking at colour contrast across the entire site to ensure this meets AA levels or higher.

Using tools such as WAVE, NVDA, axe DevTools and Lighthouse I am working towards greater accessibility of this website, and hope to work with an independent accessibility consultant sometime in the future to conduct a deeper audit.

<h3>Known issues</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>lack of hover and focus states for certain elements</li>
        <li>colour contrast is not AA level or higher in some areas</li>
        <li>improper ordering of headers on some pages</li>
        <li>email address obfuscation affects some screen readers</li>
        use of technical language on some pages that could use <a href="https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/design-and-ux/content-design-guidance/writing-style/plain-language/" title="Guidance on using plain language on documents">plain language</li>
    </ul>
