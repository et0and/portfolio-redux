This is a fully static site built with Eleventy. It is optimised for speed, reliability and accessibility. The original code for this website was developed by Piper Haywood and Sam Baldwin for their [Portfolio Starter](https://github.com/sb-ph/portfolio-starter "Github page for Portfolio Starter") theme (thank you!). You can see the [changes that I have made to this version here](https://github.com/et0and/portfolio-redux "Github page for my customised fork").
