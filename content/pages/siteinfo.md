title: About this site
---

This is a fully static site built with Eleventy. It is optimised for speed, reliability and accessibility. The original code for this website was developed by Piper Haywood and Sam Baldwin for their [Portfolio Starter]() theme (thanks guys!). You can see the changes that I have made to this version [here]().

It features the Inter typeset, serverless deployment by Now, a security certificate issued through Let's Encrypt, and is published on the decentralised web via Dat.

The site is made to operate on low power, generating 0.23g of carbon with each page view, and runs on clean renewable energy. I am working towards making this site even more efficient and lightweight, with the hopes of bringing each page view to < 0.10g of carbon emission.
