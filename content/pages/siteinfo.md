title: About this site
---

This is a fully static site built with Eleventy. It is optimised for speed, reliability and accessibility. The original code for this website was developed by Piper Haywood and Sam Baldwin for their [Portfolio Starter](https://github.com/sb-ph/portfolio-starter "Github page for Portfolio Starter") theme (thanks guys!!). You can see the [changes that I have made to this version here](https://github.com/et0and/portfolio-redux "Github page for my customised fork").

It features the [Inter typeset](https://rsms.me/inter "Inter font by Rasmus Andersson"), serverless deployment by [Vercel](https://vercel.com "Vercel, a platform for frontend frameworks and static sites"), a security certificate issued through Let's Encrypt, and is published on the decentralised web via Dat.
