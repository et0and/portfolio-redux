Assembly (asm) is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions. It is often referred to as _machine code_ for this reason. An assembler translates the assembly language syntax into their numerical equivalents.

There is no go to version of assembly - each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture and sometimes to an operating system. 

I have picked up learning assembly so that I can gain a greater understanding and appreciation of other programming languages in terms of what they provide, such as [C](/notes/c) and [Python](/notes/py) which essentially sit on top of assembly. This page will be continually developed and worked on as I learn more about it.
