C is the native language of Unix. It has come to dominate systems programming in the computer industry. It is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. 

By design, C programs run "close to the metal", meaning that it is able to efficiently map to typical machine instructions.
