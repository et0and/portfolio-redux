Maia is an proof-of-concept payments app powered by the [Stellar Network](https://stellar.org) made with decentralisation and speed in mind. The idea is to have support for mobile payments similar to Venmo or Cash App, as well as contactless payments via Apple Pay and Google Pay support as well as a physical Maia Mastercard.  

This project was made for fun, but the thought of truly decentralised and scalable payments excites me very much!
