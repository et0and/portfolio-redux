<h3>Project overview</h3>

To keep on top of our forever changing and ever-busy lives, many young professionals now look to various health apps to track their well being. As well as looking at their physical health, mental and emotional wellness is becoming an increasing point of concern for many individuals who struggle to balance work with life.

Through this CareerFoundry project, I set out to discover problems that these users were facing, what their needs were, and understand goals they had in improving their overall well being through the development of an accessible and responsive health portal. Sophia was designed as a tool and platform that would grow and change with the user, allowing users to record, learn and meditate all in one convenient location.

<h3>Exploring the problem</h3>

Before anything, I needed to better understand users’ potential problems and frustrations. From this, I would be able to start thinking about a clearly defined Problem Statement that would define the design and scope of Sophia.

<h4>Possible Problems </h4>

- Users feel unmotivated and uninspired to track well being and mood
- Access to quality educational resources is hard to find and verify
- Health, particularly mental health, can be very personal so putting it into writing on a platform can bring anxiety and worry around privacy + security
- Journalling takes time, and could be seen as a chore to complete rather than something reflective and meditative
- A lack of free time in the day to work on yourself through an app/portal

<h4>Possible Solutions </h4>

- A way of incentivising tracking well being and mood, either through gamification methods within the app or a financial angle (such as receiving a discount for health insurance should the user reach a certain stage)
- Integrating a catalog of vetted education resources backed by industry bodies, as well as guest appearances/authoring from members of the medical community
- Design app and portal to be secure from the start, with all user data encrypted (AES-256, Curve25519 or similar) and nothing shared without their explicit permission, and an option to export data off of the app freely
- Integrate journal function to be something that can be embedded or used like a widget, so that a small popup prompt is all it takes for a user to write something down. Could also allow users to record journals using voice-to-text to help with uptake.
- Have different timeframes so that users can journal for as little as 5 minutes a day, and can choose to write more if they wish. To help them get started, journals could begin with some kind of prompt

<h3>Design Process - Paris-Est d.school Design Thinking Process</h3>

Throughout this project, I followed the Design Thinking Process, adapted from Paris-Est d.school at Ecole des Ponts, to structure the design process and create a solution that would be useful for users in the development of Sophia.

Calm presents itself as the number one rated meditation and sleep health app. Unlike a typical meditation app, it positions itself as a one stop shop for mental health resources, tools, and what it calls “masterclasses” taught by experts and celebrities to help users with overcoming stress, fear, sleep, among other things.
