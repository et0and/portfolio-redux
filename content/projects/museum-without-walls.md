[The Museum Without Walls](https://tomupom.itch.io/the-museum-without-walls) was a project for the first ever [Merveilles](/projects/merveilles) [Hyperjam](/projects/hyperjam), created over a three day period within an emulated Macintosh Plus environment. While the sequencing is fairly basic, it was great fun to make work using Hypercard and watch what other people created.

You will need to be running a [Hypercard viewer or emulator](https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/index.html) in order to play this game. Otherwise, [play in the browser](https://mww.tom.so)(24MiB) and navigate to The Museum Without Walls.
