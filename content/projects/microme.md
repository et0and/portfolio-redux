Microme is a small scale indoor garden experiment ("micro-biome") for growing seedlings to be ready for the Summer. As a response to the declining population of bees, Microme has focused on growing Marigold flowers through the Winter for transplanting in the Summer.

The system currently consists of a low-power fluorescent light that is kept on 24/7, housed inside a lined box that consists of a variety of plants. Watering is done by hand, and the soil is kept rich using small amounts of organic coffee grounds.

I have never considered myself a green thumb by any means. Working on this system has allowed me to learn more about the possibilities of indoor gardening as a means of growing vegetables on a small scale. My dream would be to design and implement a kind of aquaponics system that could operate indoors or outdoors, growing seasonal plants and vegetables throughout the year.

The project is set to expand to include a greater variety of flora, automated watering and mulching, and be modular in design to allow for easy transport and set up.
