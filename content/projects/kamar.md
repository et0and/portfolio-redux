<h3>Background + The Problem </h3>

Schools across Aotearoa rely on KAMAR, a school management system used by teachers and administrators for virtually every aspect of running a school. Attendance, grades, reports, medical data, parent data, and so on are all on KAMAR, and is one of the most widely used and critical tools for schools that have it deployed.

In an effort to keep data secure, KAMAR maintains a strict timeout and logoff policy. After a minute of inactivity, KAMAR logs the user off and forces them to manually sign in with username and password after every timeout. The process is slow and buggy, with the client app occasionally not registering and signalling the timeout to the user, causing them to potentially lose progress on what they were working on.

<br><br>

<h3>The Solution </h3>

Design a user flow that has teachers and administrators sign in normally at the start of every day. In the event of a timeout, they can sign back in quickly using a personalised pin code (already set as their user).

<h3>Process outline - the Double Diamond framework</h3>

Following the double diamond framework, user research could be diverged and the scope of the problem space clarified. After diverging, I converged and identified the specific "How Might We" and benefit sought:
