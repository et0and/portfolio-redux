<h3>Summary</h3>

In TƒÅmaki Makaurau, young artists and art historians have long faced a challenge in finding a comprehensive and up-to-date list of public art spaces. The absence of a current central resource, even from the Council, has made it difficult for students to discover and connect with the local art scene. This project aimed to address this need by creating a dynamic, user-friendly map showcasing public art galleries in Auckland. With a focus on including both well-known institutions and lesser-known smaller spaces, our map enables users to explore and engage with the vibrant art scene in their local communities. 

By providing an accessible and current resource, we empower young artists and art historians to deepen their understanding of Auckland's art landscape and foster connections within the creative community.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

The local art scene in Auckland is thriving, with a diverse range of public art galleries showcasing both established and emerging talents. However, young artists and art historians often struggle to navigate this landscape due to a lack of comprehensive, up-to-date information on public art spaces. Existing resources, including those provided by the Council, are either not maintained or fail to include smaller, indie/artist-run spaces. Recognising this gap, our project set out to create a dynamic, user-friendly map that would enable users to see the whole picture of Auckland's art spaces. This case study outlines our research, design process, technical implementation, and user testing, demonstrating how we created an engaging and accessible tool that empowers users to connect with Auckland's vibrant art community.
