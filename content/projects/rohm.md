Rohm is a collection of hyperlinked Markdown research files designed to be read and traversed using [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com) or equivalent alternatives such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) (pictured below) and [org-roam](https://orgroam.com). 

It is a growing collection of knowledge mostly related to my teaching practice, with a focus on DVC. Anyone is free to download, modify and distribute these files as they wish as per the Creative Commons Zero license (no attribution is necessary, work is entered into the public domain).
