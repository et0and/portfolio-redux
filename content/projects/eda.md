[Eda](https://eda.fund) is a socially responsible investment (SRI) fund whose focus is on investing in arts projects. The fund does not seek to act as a competitor to existing Aotearoa/New Zealand funding bodies, but act as an additional helping hand to those looking for further funding. Eda is focused on funding initiatives which contribute to the projects of young practitioners in TƒÅmaki Makaurau/Auckland, particularly those who would not be targeted by larger funding bodies.

There are no artistic restrictions for how individuals, groups or communities use Eda funding. The only requirement is that a record is kept and provided to Eda on how the funds are spent, and that these records are published and made transparent on the Eda website.

The fund is currently in the process of organising itself, but applications are due to open November 2020.
