<h2>Developing and deploying a centralised knowledge hub </h2>

Tools: Figma, Premiere Pro, Next JS
Team: R.K. (manager) and myself (designer, researcher, developer)
Timeline of Two Years

<h3>Background + The Problem </h3>

Takapuna Grammar School launched their maker space (nee Innovation Space) for students and staff in 2020. With a wide range of different tools and machinery, there is a high learning curve for anyone new to the space with students ranging from years 9 - 13 (12 - 18 year olds) and teachers. Without some form of training, accessibility of this space is limited.

<h3>The Solution </h3>

Design, develop and deploy a centralised knowledge hub that exists both online in the form of a website and offline in the form of posters. The hub will contain different guides for using the tools and machines, as well as steps to follow for certain goals.

<h3>Design Process - the 5 Ws Method </h3>

*What is the product?* - A centralised knowledge hub

*Who is it for?* - Students and staff of Takapuna Grammar School

*Why does it need to be created?* - To help students and staff onboard and train themselves to use the tools and machines in Te Wāhi Auaha

*What does it need to do?* - Instruct students and staff on how to use specific tools/machines, as well as guide them on common goals they want to achieve (e.g. “I want to 3D print something...”)

*Where and When will it be used?* - At Takapuna Grammar School, to be used anytime inside or outside of curriculum

> "Students and Staff would have <u>agency</u> over learning about how to use a certain tool or machine in the maker space, so they can be free in realising their <u>individual</u> projects with <u>confidence</u>."

<h3>Definitions </h3>

*Agency* - giving users control over their creative experience

*Confidence* - in their ability to achieve or solve a problem

*Individual* - what is specific to the student/staff member, which may not fall into a particular curriculum area

<h3>User Research </h3>
<h4>Primary Research Method - utilising student voice </h4>

My initial assumptions leading up to undertaking this research was the following:

- Many students don’t read emails
- Many students don’t read daily notices/newsletter
- Many students struggle to find where digital material for their classes are located
- Many students feel that having a single organised hub/location for digital materials would help them with their learning and organisation
- Many students feel discouraged from going through notifications due to the sheer amount of alerts that teachers would post and put out on a daily basis, making it difficult to filter through the noise

Using a simple survey, I gathered responses from a pool of 100 different students using Tally to gather some data regarding the above assumptions. The findings were:

- The vast majority of students surveyed do not read their students emails (85%), with the most popular reason being that they felt there was so much being sent that it was hard to keep on top of
- Nearly half of all students surveyed do not ready the daily notices and school newsletters (47%)
- Close to a third of all students surveyed said that they struggle to find what they need for their classes on Google Classroom (28%)
- A large majority of students surveyed expressed that it would be useful to have one set place to find digital materials for their respective classes, with a few noting that Google Classroom already did this to a certain extent but sometimes was hard to look through
