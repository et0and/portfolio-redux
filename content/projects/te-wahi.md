<h3>Background + The Problem </h3>

Takapuna Grammar School launched their maker space (nee Innovation Space) for students and staff in 2020. With a wide range of different tools and machinery, there is a high learning curve for anyone new to the space with students ranging from years 9 - 13 (12 - 18 year olds) and teachers. Without some form of training, accessibility of this space is limited.

<br><br>

<h3>The Solution </h3>

Design, develop and deploy a centralised knowledge hub that exists both online in the form of a website and offline in the form of posters. The hub will contain different guides for using the tools and machines, as well as steps to follow for certain goals.

<br><br>

<h3>Design Process - the 5 Ws Method </h3>

*What is the product?* - A centralised knowledge hub

*Who is it for?* - Students and staff of Takapuna Grammar School

*Why does it need to be created?* - To help students and staff onboard and train themselves to use the tools and machines in Te Wāhi Auaha

*What does it need to do?* - Instruct students and staff on how to use specific tools/machines, as well as guide them on common goals they want to achieve (e.g. “I want to 3D print something...”)

*Where and When will it be used?* - At Takapuna Grammar School, to be used anytime inside or outside of curriculum


<br><br>

> "Students and Staff would have <u>agency</u> over learning about how to use a certain tool or machine in the maker space, so they can be free in realising their <u>individual</u> projects with <u>confidence</u>."

---

<br><br>

<h3>Definitions </h3>

*Agency* - giving users control over their creative experience

*Confidence* - in their ability to achieve or solve a problem

*Individual* - what is specific to the student/staff member, which may not fall into a particular curriculum area


<br><br>

<h3>User Research</h3>
<h4>Primary Research Method - utilising student voice</h4>

Some initial assumptions leading up to undertaking this research was the following:

- Many students don’t read emails
- Many students don’t read daily notices/newsletter
- Many students struggle to find where digital material for their classes are located
- Many students feel that having a single organised hub/location for digital materials would help them with their learning and organisation
- Many students feel discouraged from going through notifications due to the sheer amount of alerts that teachers would post and put out on a daily basis, making it difficult to filter through the noise

<br/>
Using a simple survey, responses were gathered from a pool of 100 different students using Tally to gather some data regarding the above assumptions. The findings were:

- The vast majority of students surveyed do not read their students emails (85%), with the most popular reason being that they felt there was so much being sent that it was hard to keep on top of
- Nearly half of all students surveyed do not ready the daily notices and school newsletters (47%)
- Close to a third of all students surveyed said that they struggle to find what they need for their classes on Google Classroom (28%)
- A large majority of students surveyed expressed that it would be useful to have one set place to find digital materials for their respective classes, with a few noting that Google Classroom already did this to a certain extent but sometimes was hard to look through

<h3>First design and feedback round</h3>

<br><br>

To start with, a very basic homepage was created to act as the central hub to all matters related to the maker space. To accompany this site were a series of A3 posters for display in the space. Each poster contained a short description of the core tools and machines used in the space, with a QR code that directed students to a video tutorial demonstrating how to use said tool/machine.

<br><br>

Response to the initial site design was mostly positive. Again, utilising student voice and also some comments from staff, most respondents rated the site highly but also noted that the site could host some further guides and tutorials in greater depth:

- "... a clean design ... could use more information on how to use more of the software in the space"
- "... would be great to be able to search for stuff"
- "... the links to the guides aren't that clear ... could be a button?"

<br><br>

To address this, the site was redesigned to include clear buttons on the homepage for the most common flows, which were the tool guides, project guides, a newly launched online exhibition space, and a form for submitting files for 3D printed or laser cutting/engraving. The tool and project guides were written up in greater detail and hosted on Gitbook, with full search capability and on-the-fly media compression to help students with limited or slow internet connections.
