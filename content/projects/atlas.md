[Atlas](https://atlas.tom.org.nz) is an ongoing archive of reference material, designed for both online and offline (print) use.

Inspired by Gerhard Richter's *Atlas* project, I wanted to create a research tool built using the are.na API.

Atlas pulls my most recent research and reference material from an are.na channel, which is then displayed as a plain HTML page which can be printed for use in my journals and books.
